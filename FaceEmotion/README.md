# Face Emotion classifier
This project aims to build a CNN classifier for face emotions. We will mainly be using the CK+ dataset for the classifier.
This classifier will be built around images first, but the overall goal is to developp a web app that can analyze faces in a video. A second head for localizing the face might be necessary later on.
